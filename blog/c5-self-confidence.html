      <h3>What is the Relationship between Mindfulness and Self Awareness?</h3>
      <p>To me I believe that mindfullness and self awareness are very similar, if not the same thing to an extent. Both can be trained to improve your everyday life, and are both used in order to master your emotional intelligence and emotional states.</p>
      <h3>My Experience with Body Scanning</h3>
      <p>Body scanning is something that is rather new to me, I usually do it before I go to sleep or while lying in bed. It is very helpful to relax and bring on a state of calm and mindfullness. Though I do find my mind gets distracted easily.</p>
      <h3>What I Took Away From Search Inside Yourself "My Emotions are not Me" Section</h3>
      <p>My Emotions are Not Me. This was an interesting chapter, not letting your emotions control the outcome of a situation I believe is a very good way to look at life. Being able to calm yourself on demand I believe is a very usefull and important skill, as it stops you from overreacting and causing a bigger problem. Though it is important to understand when to use your emotions and be able to justify the effect, as to not bottle them up.</p>
