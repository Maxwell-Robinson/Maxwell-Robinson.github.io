        <h3>How Does Javascript Compare With HTML and CSS?</h3>
        <p> I am finding Javascript to be ALOT more complicated than HTML and CSS. Although the fundamental basics are still roughly similar, im finding it much much much harder to wrap my head around how to make javascript work. Even ater finishing alot of work with java, im still finding some parts of it to not make sence, or not sure how i am making things work.</p>
        <h3>Explain Control Flow and Loops using an Example from Everyday Life.</h3>
        <p>Control flow and loops are just like your daily routine. An example is how every day you open your eyes and plant your feet on the floor and then probbly get dressed, have breakfast and brush your teeth. This is just the same a loops and flow, due to the fact that it is something that you do every day in the same order.</p>
        <h3>What is the Difference Between Accessing data from Arrays, and Literal Objects?</h3>
        <p>One of the main differences betwen accessing data from Arrays compared to Objects, is the fact that arrays have an order, where as objects dont, and the info can be accessed in any order. Arrays store their data in a much more uniform way, comparable to a table, whereas objects dont, and are much easier to quickly pick out important bits of information.</p>
        <h3>What are Functions and why they are useful</h3>
        <p>Functions are pieces of code which are able to be "called" upon to give a result. You could have a list of commands which you would like to print out over and over again, but with differend variables, this is where a "function" will come in handy, instead of writing out lines and lines of code, your function will be able to reach the same result but with conciderably less code.</p>
