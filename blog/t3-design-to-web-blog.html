             <h3>What is a Responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h3>

        <p>a responsive website is a website which changes its layout/size based on the size of the screen. The reason for this is to keep the iewers experience of the website enjoyable across the board. Due to tablets and spartphones, along with laptops and desktops having differend sized sreens, websites need to be able to alter their layout to accomadate for the change, otherwise you would need to make a whole new website just for the different platforms.</p>

        <h3>What is Mobile First Design, and why is it Important?</h3>

       <p>Due to the fact that smartphones are becoming ever more popular, users are spening more time on their phones looking at websites, rather than their laptop/desktop. As mentioned in the previous question, designers would make two differend websites to accomodate for both desktop/laptop and smartphone, as sites became more complex, the two site wouled become harder and harder to keep up to date, so now thanks to HTML guidlines evoving, you can now make a website which accomodates both smartphone and laptop/desktop, which alters its layout according to the size of the screen.</p>

        <h3>What are Frameworks, and their pros & cons?</h3>
        <p>Frameworks are sets of pre-build stylesheets, which assist developers in reating a new website, they save alot of time as you dont have to write the code manually, but in doing this you may find that you dont know how things work, due to the framework doing it automatically.</p> 

        <h3>What is a Wireframe and why do we use it?</h3>
        <p>wireframes are like the blueprints of a website, which you creat prior to designing. thhey can be made using software on a computer or can be drawn up by hand. in my case i drew them by hand.</p>
         <div class="six columns">
            <a href="../images/desktop.JPG"></a>
          </div>
          <div class="sic columns">
            <a href="../images/smartphone.JPG"></a>
         </div>
         <p>it is a good way to wrap your head around how the site will look when it is finished, and also to remind you of what you you wanted from your website.</p>
      </div>
