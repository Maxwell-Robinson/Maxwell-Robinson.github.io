        <h3>Have you Ever been Stuck on a Problem and Solved it in an Elegant way?</h3>
        <p>YES!</p>
        <h3>What was the Problem?</h3>
        <p>A problem that I had when i began coding on this course, was trying to figure out how to make a pricure into a hyper link, i spent nearly an hour trying to find out how i made it work with no luck!</p>
        <h3>What Techniques did you use to Solve it?</h3>
        <p>I first took to google to see if anyone else had the same quiestion as me, and sure enough there were quite a few people who had asked the same thing. So that helped me find out how to make it. But then, i needed to find a way to re-size images to fit into my blog post, this was no problem as there are lots of sites online which can resize images to fit your specs.</p>
        <h3>How did this make you feel?</h3>
        <p>Even though this was such an easy fix, i felt really good! I felt like i had overcome and obsticle which at first i thought would take me a LOOOONG time to figure out, finally passing it made me feel like i had accomplished something, and lifted weight of pressure off my shoulders.</p>
        <h3>How Confident are you with Pseudocoding?</h3>    
        <p>I like to think I understand how to do good pseudocoding in order to better understand what I'm doing but if I sit down and start writing something, my first instinct isn't to pseudocode out what I'm about to make</p>
        <h3>How about the Idea of Trying Something?</h3>
        <p>This is definitely my style. I'll usually save copies of something I work on and strip out all of my work in order to try a different approach</p>
        <h3>Rubber Ducky Method?</h3>
        <p>I havn't actually tried this yet, though i think that it would ne really helpful, though I might feel a bit strang talking to a duck, although, THAT WILL NOT STOP ME!</p>
        <h3>Reading Error Messages?</h3>
        <p>I read error messages all the time, they are so helpful! sometimes i forget to put a semi-colon at the end of some code, and its always there to remember for me, which has made me more aware of placing the semi-colon at the end of my code.</p>
        <h3>Console.logging?</h3>
        <p>I'd say I need to do this more before hand. I do use it a lot but mainly if something isn't working rather than before to make sure it'll work.</p>
        <h3>Googling?</h3>
        <p>I always use this, not only for coding but for lots of things in everyday life or even gaming, google is the most helful thing ever.</p>
        <h3>Asking peers for Help?</h3>
        <p>Not a huge fan of asking people for help, makes me feel quote on quote "dumb", and i feel like I should know what to do already. This is a really bad mindset I know, but it is something that I always shy away from.</p>
        <h3>Asking Coaches for Help?</h3>
        <p>Only for very specefic problems, things that nothing else i do can get the answer for me.</p>
        <h3>Can you Tell me What .map() does?</h3>
        <p>From what I found, It is used to convert one array into another. it takes the values in an existing array and uses a small piece of code called a function to manipulate those values in some way, and create a new array with the new values. The .map() method could be used by a function to take some numbers out of one array, multiply all those numbers by two, and then put the results inside a new array. This is a very basic example.</p>
        <h3>How about .filter()?</h3>
        <p>is similar to the .map() method. The difference is that when the function looks through the existing array, it creates the new array only with values that pass a test. Some examples: it may look through some names and return those that start with a particular letter; or it may only return values that are greater than 100. It will then put the values it finds in a new array - it doesn't actually change the values as .map() does.</p>
        <h3>And .reduce()?</h3>
        <p> takes the values in an array and reduces them to a single value. It can do this with numbers by adding them all together (or any calculation that uses two or more values). It can take an array with a bunch of smaller arrays inside it, take the values out of those and turn all of them into one big array. It can also take words inside an array and stick them all together in a big sentence. The beauty of .reduce() is that it simplifies a lot of the sort of basic coding that would spit out a single value anyway.</p>
