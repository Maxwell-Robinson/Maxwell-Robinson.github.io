        <h3>What did you Learn from you Mindfullness Conversation?</h3>
        <p>Coming from a family who has brought me up to be mindfull my whole life found it to be just like a normal conversation. Alot of my family members and friends already come up to me when they want to unload smething that has happened, due to the fact that they know i will listen with my full attention, and not try to talk over them etc. </p>
        <h3> What Three Suggested Techniques will you use to Sustain your Practice?</h3>
        <p>Doing less than you can do and taking a breath a day are both things which i do unknowingly. When i start feeling like im getting swamped in the studies, i generally like to go clear my mind for a few minutes outside before jumping back into study.</p>
        <h3>Any other Musings?</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy watching/reading the "Search Inside Yourself" book, its becoming something that do at the end of the week, and it helps me regain my composure to get ready for the next week of study! Also being reminded of being mindful, and my inner workings is really helpful as it brings me back to a state of mindfullness.</p>
