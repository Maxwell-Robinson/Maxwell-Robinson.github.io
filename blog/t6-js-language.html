        <h3>Parentheses <code> () </code> </h3>
        <p>Parentheses are used are for: grouping or containing expressions or parameters. It's rather simple: expressions are just things like a calculation (4+3) or a comparison (a < 10). Parameters are sometimes what a function needs to run a piece of code: say if it needs two numbers to do a calculation, then the parameters can be those two numbers</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Brackets <code> [] </code></h3>
        <p>Brackets are for building arrays and for "Bracket notation" Arrays store data in a format like a table or spreadsheet, with rows and columns, and "Bracket notation" is literaly just having somthing inbetween brackets.</p>
        <h3>Curly Braces<code>{}</code></h3>
        <p>Curly braces are very important. They mark the start and end of code that is running in part of your script. Each separate bit of code needs to run inside its own set of curly braces, so you will commonly see one set "nested" inside another, and more nested inside that, and so on. It can get confusing, which is why coders need special text editing programs that keep track of where things are.</p>
        <p>The seccond use would be for building objects, simply put, opjects are like arrays but with more complex data, the curly brackets are used to isolate each piece of data.</p>
        <h3>Double Quotes<code>""</code>and Single Quotes<code>''</code></h3>
        <p>these two are more of less interchangable, and can be nested inside each other (alternating). These are used to contain "strings" which are combinations of numbers and letters which are interperated as scentences by the computer. Also you have to be consistent with your quotes, you can not begin with double quotes and finish with single quotes, you have to close a string with the quotes that began the string, otherwise the PC will think that all the code after the latter quotation marks with be part of a new sting.</p>
        <p>Although I said single and double quotes are interchangeable, there's an instance when they aren't. If you're using an online program to check that your Objects are properly laid out, you must use double quotes.</p>
