          <h3> What Learnings did I Take Away from Chapter One?</h3>
          <p>The main thing that i took away from chaper one was how the brain can be trained to control/optimize your state of mind. An examlple would be from Christopher deCharms who uses "neuroimaging thearpy" to help paitents deal with pain. I think that this is such a valuable piece of information, knowing you decide your state of mind, and can change it accordingly.</p>

          <h3>How did I find the Two Minutes of Mindfulness?</h3>
          <p> growing up, I have been lucky to have a family who are very aware of mindfulness and have lead me to a positive up-bringing. so the two minutes of mindfulness was nothing new to me, usually throughout the day i will stop what i am doing and be "present", meaning I dont think of what happend yesterday, or what will be happening later, i just think about now and take everything in and appreciate it. Though this two minutes of mindfulness was great, it lifted my spirits and calmed my mind, and just made me appreciate this experience that i am involved in.
