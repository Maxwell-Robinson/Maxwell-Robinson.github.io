            <h3>What is your Take on Dev</h3>
            <p>I believe EDA is somewhere which really stands out from other courses. From what i have heard about EDA, it is a hard working and cultured environment which has a large focus on pair working and team building. All the help you need is provided but you yourself have to make it work for you, "I have to take control of me own learning". After watching the Fire Side chat, it has only asserted what i believed. Words which come to mind when i now think of Dev Acadaemy are: Cultured, Teamwork, Creative, Driven.</p>
            <h3>What are your Impressions?</h3>
            <p>My impressions so far after my first week.. EXCITED! Already after one week i have learned the basics of html, CSS, command and github MOTIVATED! From learning so much already makes me want more. I feel slightly nervous, just hearing about how much harder it will get but i will step up to the challange, as i am also excited to see how much i can accomplish! </p>
            <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
            <p>The Dev culture.
                Provoking. Dev provokes thought and eagerness to learn.
                Team Focused. improves skills of communication and interaction by working with pairs.
                Fun and Fair. Everyone is treated equal. Whether you have 5 years of web development experience under your belt or 5 minutes, you will both be given the same work, aswell as learn off eachother
                based off my opinion, i believe i will fit right in. Everyone has the same mindset of wanting to accomplish and learn great things, i believe i will make many new and good friends.</p>
            <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
            <p>What i expect out of dev academy is a huge new wealth of knowledge about coding and web design which will help me get my foot in the door for a future job. I am confident that i will achieve this as EDA goes up and above with their courses. It intergrates teamwork, self management, and self development which im my opinion are all nessesary and important skill to have to assist in progressing through a career.</p>
            <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
            <p>I am exceedingly excited to be working in this type of envoronmenet! Obviously alot of though has gone into making Dev work the way it is. Promoting nessesary skills between pairs and individually, practically setting you up to begin or continue your journey. This excitment is also followed with nervousness, i find my thoughts sometimes focused on the idea that i wont be accepted due to my age and knowledge on web design, though it does make me want to work harder knowing this, so i can suprise and wow pairs with how driven and motivated i am.</p>
