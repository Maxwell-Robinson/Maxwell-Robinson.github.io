HTML is the foundations, the wood, and the nails which are used to build the structure of the house. CSS is the decorating of the house, so the paint color, and what your inhouse decorm will look like. then Javascript what makes everything go, like the T.V remote or your radio controls.</p>
            <p>DOM on the otherhand is like a Tree, you can add branches, cut branches off, Grow new branches, grow or trim the leaves, or modify the whole tree entirely, by changing the trunk!</p>
