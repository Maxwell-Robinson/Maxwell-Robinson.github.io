        <h3> Can you Think of an Analogy to Describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you Describe it to your non-Technical Friend?</h3>
        <p>An analagy for HTML and CSS (and javascrpit) would be to think of it all like building a house. HTML is the foundations, the wood, and the nails which are used to build the structure of the house. CSS is the decorating of the house, so the paint color, and what your inhouse decorm will look like. then Javascript what makes everything go, like the T.V remote or your radio controls.</p>
        <p>DOM on the otherhand is like a Tree, you can add branches, cut branches off, Grow new branches, grow or trim the leaves, or modify the whole tree entirely, by changing the trunk!</p>

        <h3>What does Boxifying mean?</h3>
        <p> Boxifying means to think of a webpage like a group of boxes stacked together. There are the main boxes such as, Head, body, footer and asie. but also these boxs contain other boxes, such as paragraphs, imgs, headers etc. boxifying means to identify the boxes of a website.</p>

        <h3>What is the Box model?</h3>
        <p>The box model is essentially a box that wraps around all HTML elements. It consists of Margins, borders, padding and the actual content. </p>
