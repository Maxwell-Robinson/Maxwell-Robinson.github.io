        <h3>How did the "Process over Product" concept change the way you Tackled the site design, and rebuild?</h3>
        <p>To be honest it really helped me alot. When i started the sight design and rebuild, i thought i would be fine, but once i started, the whole project got out of hand, and i was not sure what i was doing! i was looking at other peoples completed sites, wondering how they even did some of the things that they did, but then, after reading the "Process over Product" i calmed down alot, and realised that i have no experience of this while others do, so i can expect fully functional site like theirs, but i can work my hardest to come close, and one day i will be at that level aswell!</p>
        <h3> What did I Think About Meditation Before I Read Chapter 2?</h3>
        <p>As of writing this passage, i am yet to begin to read chapter 2. What do i think of meditation? As someone who has heard about it quite a bit but not really tried meditation, i think it is a way of relieving stress, bringing your mental space back down to earth, and a way of grounding yourself. Meditation to me is a way of relieving yourself of the stresses of the world, and a way to just focus on you.</p>
        <h3>What New Things have you Learned About Meditation?</h3>
        <p>I have learned that meditation is like mental training, think of it like a gym, you lift weights to get stronger, where as meditation is like that. Keep your thoughts on track, every time they start to wander, pulling them back to to meditation is just like a rep at the gym. Also, it can be related to riding a bike, constantly making "micro recoveries" to keep yourself balanced. Learned how to propperly sit and also how to keep your mind in a state of peace.</p>
        <h3>Did any of the Suggested Mediation Techniques Stand out to you</h3> 
        <p> Yes, as mentioned in the previous question, i have now propperly learned how to  sit<br> 
        Back straight "like an arrow"<br>  
        Legs crossed "lotus position"<br>
        Shoulders relaxed, held up and back "like a vulture" Etc..<br>
        Also, how to keep your mind in a state of meditation, it involves making countless micro recoveries. an analagy would be to ride a bike and keep your balance, constantly re-adjusting your postion. i started off with little knowledge of meditation, but after reading this chapter, i feel like a am well versed in the basics</p>
        <h3> Any other Musings?</h3>
        <p> Not in particular, but this chapter has definatly opened my eyes to the beginnings of meditation, and has opened the door to me using this technique more often.</p>
