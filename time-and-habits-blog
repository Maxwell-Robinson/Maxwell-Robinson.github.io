 <h2> Which Timebox and Habits did you try out?</h2>
    <p>
     Over the course of this first week i have learned alot of new ways to manage my time and control my workflow, some being <u>Flow or "in the zone"</u> and how to controll how to get "into the zone". <u>Meditation</u>, something that I have never tried in my life but wish i had come across it sooner. <u>Mindfulness</u>, this is something that my family has always taught me to do, not just with work, but also in just general life, i find that keeping your mind focused on "the now" reduces stress levels and also keeps you focused on the task at hand. and last but not least, the <u>Pomodoro Technique</u> this helped me keep my mind focused on the task at hand and not get bored/burnt out of it, I liked the variety this technique brought along with it as it kept me from losing focus.

     <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
     <p> Meditation stood out to me the most, simply due to the fact that i have very little prior knowledge about meditation. Learning about meditation this week though has sparked my interest, the amount of effort you put in to the amount of energy and cognitive function you get out of a short 5 minute session suprised me so much!
     Flow is also something that interestes me alot, learning how to help put yourself in a state of mind which increases productivity in the workspace is something that I think is something worth looking into!

     <h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2>
     <p> 
     So far i have tried out the habits and skils which stood out to me the most and i will definatly continue to use all of them! But the ones which i will experiment with are meditation, due to the fact that i know very little about it still, and i think that it is just such an amazing habit to get into which will definatly improve the way i work. And also the Pomodoro Technique, due to the fact that i believe it helps me stay focused and in a state of "flow" for longer, seen as im not getting burnt out of one topic, but swapping through different topics, slowly chipping away at them.
